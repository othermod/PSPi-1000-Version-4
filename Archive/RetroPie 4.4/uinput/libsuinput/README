 Libsuinput
============

Uinput is Linux kernel module which allows attaching userspace device
drivers into the Linux kernel. However, its ioctl-interface is pretty
low level from an application developer's perspective. This library
provides a set of helper functions for making the usage of uinput
easier. Libsuinput can be considered thin, because it operates on the
same file descriptors as traditional ioctl commands.
